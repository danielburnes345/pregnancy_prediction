<b>Pregnancy Prediction using Recurrent Neural Network</b>

<b>Overview</b>

This project generates and processes user behavior data to train and evaluate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for pregnancy prediction.
The model uses synthetic data based on a real study of pregnancy likelihood and predicts the probability of pregnancy based on sexual activity and mood patterns.

<b>Tech Stack</b>

Python – Data processing and model training

PyTorch – RNN implementation

Pandas / NumPy – Data handling and preprocessing

Matplotlib – Visualization of model performance

<b>Key Features</b>

Data Generation: Implements a data simulation function derived from a pregnancy prediction study

Model Training: Trains a Recurrent Neural Network to predict pregnancy likelihood

Evaluation: Outputs accuracy metrics and visualizes model performance over epochs

Exploratory Analysis: Includes preprocessing and visualization of behavioral trends
